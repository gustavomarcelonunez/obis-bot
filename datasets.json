            "abstract": "Original provider:\nWildlife Conservation Society\n\nDataset credits:\nWildlife Conservation Society\n\nAbstract:\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has digitally captured the Townsend Whaling Charts that were published as a series of 4 charts with the article titled \"The distribution of certain whales as shown by logbook records of American whale ships\" by Charles Haskins Townsend in the journal Zoologica in 1935.\nThe 4 charts show the locations of over 50,000 captures of 4 whale species; sperm whales (36,908), right whales (8,415), humpback whales (2,883) and bowhead whales (5,114). Capture locations were transcribed from North American (\u201cYankee\u201d) pelagic whale vessel log books dating from 1761 to 1920 and plotted onto nautical charts in a Mercator projection by a cartographer. Each point plotted on the charts represents the location of a whaling ship on a day when one or more whales were taken and is symbolized by month of the year using a combination of color and open and closed circles.\nTownsend and his cartographer plotted vessel locations as accurately as possible according to log book records.  When plotting locations on an earlier sperm whale chart published in 1931 the cartographer spaced points where locations were very dense, \"extending areas slightly\" for a number of whaling grounds. However, for charts in preparation at this time, Townsend states that \"this difficulty is avoided by omitting some of the data, rather than extend the ground beyond actual whaling limits.\" We assumed that this statement refers to the 1935 charts but there is still some question as to whether the cartographer did in fact space locations and thus expand whaling grounds. \n\nPurpose:\nThis dataset provides point features that represent the historical locations of right whale catches taken by North American pelagic whaling vessels between 1761 to 1920. Points were derived from 4 charts that were first scanned on a large format scanner at a resolution of 200 dpi. The charts were then georeferenced in the native projection of the charts, the Mercator projection, using GIS software (ESRI ArcView 3.2). Each vessel capture location plotted on the charts was then digitized as a point feature and attributed with the month of capture. One GIS file (ESRI shapefile) was then created for each whale species represented by the charts; sperm whale, right whale, humpback whale and bowhead whale.\n\nDigitizing errors include missed points, particularly from areas of dense chart locations, and incorrect assignment of month of capture because of difficulty distinguishing between chart colors. However to limit these errors multiple checks of digitized and chart locations were made and color enhancements of chart scans were used to ensure correct month assignments. Overall we are confident that at least 95% of catch locations have been digitized and that at least 95% of month attributes are correct.\n\nFor full resolution digital copies of the Townsend charts please contact Gillian Woolmer (gwoolmer@wcs.org).\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2023-01-31] The year of the date was changed from 1913 to 1849, the midpoint of the time range of the data.\n\nWCS digitized the Townsend whaling charts in 2002 using ArcView 3.2 from ESRI. The information WCS has captured for each point location is the whale species (based on the chart) and the month, based on the chart point symbol. Exact dates and number of whales taken was not possible to determine. Right whale captures were separated into northern and southern right whale species, based on their geographic location.\n\nSince time, count, day, and year were not available, \"00:00:00,\" 1, 1, and 1913 were used, respectively. Only month is available.",

            "abstract": "This dataset contains the eDNA data collected as a part of the UNESCO eDNA expeditions in Marine World Heritage Sites project in 2022-2024. The project was coordinated in collaboration with the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) of IOC-UNESCO and the marine programme of the UNESCO World Heritage Center, and funded by the government of Flanders (Kingdom of Belgium). The samples were collected with citizen science eDNA sampling kits, containing a syringe and a filter, and preserved with Longmire's buffer, before sequencing at a central laboratory. Five different biomarkers were analysed, including 12SMifish, Mimammal, Teleo, 16S-Vert and COI markers. The sequences were analysed with the PacMAN pipeline and quality controlled including a validation check by local scientists and site managers as well as compared to existing knowledge on species distributions in OBIS and GBIF. The full sampling protocols and materials are available on the project website (https://www.unesco.org/en/edna-training-materials?hub=66910), and the bioinformatics pipeline is on github (https://github.com/iobis/PacMAN-pipeline). The data can also be explored on the eDNA expeditions dashboard (https://dashboard.ednaexpeditions.org/).",

            "abstract": "This is an OBIS formatted version of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Maritimes Region Whale Sightings Database for visual sightings of cetaceans (e.g. whales, dolphins and porpoises) mostly from the Scotian Shelf/Bay of Fundy portions of Canada's east coast, as well as the Gulf of St. Lawrence in recent years. The collectors of these sightings are diverse (e.g. NGO researchers, fisheries observers, private consultants, etc.), mostly on-board ships and mostly collected since the late 1990s.\n\nThe horizontal resolution of the data (e.g. distance between sightings) varies by a vast amount - just metres in some areas like the Bay of Fundy, and tens to thousands of kilometers elsewhere, like off northern Labrador. A small portion of the database  are standardized marine mammal survey data, where a line transect sightings survey is conducted and sightings effort is logged. Only these survey data allow for the calculation of Sightings Per Unit Effort and the use of Distance Sampling methods, leading to a statistically-based, unbiased abundance estimate. This information is not provided in this resource.\n\nThis resource contains presence information only. No absences are recorded.\n\nThe design and structure of the main project database is consistent with other DFO databases and with the University of Rhode Island (URI) whale sightings database. Departures from the URI standard (mainly species and gear codes) are easily translated by users of either database.\n\nThis database is a compilation of a number of datasets, most of the data being gathered opportunistically. More detailed information on the individual sightings, human interactions, and animal behaviour are available from the source database and the resource creator should be contacted.",

It includes over 1600 marine mammals and its comprehensiveness makes this collection the best of its kind in Australia.\nThe collection has also historical importance as it includes many specimens from early expeditions in Australia and to the subantarctic Islands and Antarctica. Well-known people such as Sir Douglas Mawson, Edgar R. Waite and Hedley Finlayson have contributed to the collection.\nData downloaded from ALA (http://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co126) on 2022-06-01 and non-marine records have been excluded. Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species.",

            "abstract": "Historically, southern right whales were widely distributed in New Zealand waters. This population, was driven to commercial extinction following extensive exploitation during the early 19th century (Dawbin 1986). It was further depleted by illegal Soviet hunting in 1950-1970 (Tormosov et al. 1998). While right whale sightings around mainland New Zealand remain rare, up to 165 whales can be found at the Auckland Is in a single day during winter. Despite what appears to be adequate habitat along the eastern coastline, the whales' distribution is largely limited to Port Ross, Laurie Harbour and waters around Enderby I. The relatively small area where so many whales congregate means that at peak season the density of whales at the Auckland Is is very high (approximately 8 whales/km2). The residency period extends from at least early May to at least the end of September, with peak numbers in July and August. ",

Population surveys were conducted by CETAP to assess the distribution and abundance of whales, dolphins and sea turtles inhabiting the study area.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nTurtles: Testudines (173749) =&gt; Testudines (948936)\n\nThis dataset is a subset of CETAP sightings, extracting opportunistic sighting records, with the addition of taxonomic information of species sighted. The full dataset may be available upon request. Requests for more data, further details on the dataset, proper use of the dataset, and questions should be directed to the primary contact person.\n\nAlso note that the metadata is in edits. For further details of the dataset or questions, contact the contact person.\n\nSighting points that are more than 2km inland were eliminated.\nThose from 1km to 2km inland can be considered as on-water sightings.\n\nAccuracy of date/time varies.

            "abstract": "NOAA and the U.S. Navy are working to better understand underwater sound within the National Marine Sanctuary System. From 2018-2021, these agencies worked with numerous scientific partners to study sound within seven national marine sanctuaries and one marine national monument, which includes waters off Hawai\u2018i and the east and west coasts. Standardized measurements were used to assess sounds produced by marine animals, physical processes (e.g., wind and waves), and human activities. Collectively, this information will help NOAA and the Navy measure sound levels and baseline acoustic conditions in sanctuaries. This work is a continuation of ongoing Navy and NOAA monitoring and research, including efforts by NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.\nThis dataset includes the SanctSound species detections based on recorded sounds produced by marine animals with those observations aggregated to daily presence. The full resolution SanctSound species detection products can be discovered and accessed at the NCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive along with the dataset-specific metadata, processing details and citation. Sound sources were extracted from the SanctSound audio dataset also available at the the NCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive (NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and U.S Navy. 2021. SanctSound Raw Passive Acoustic Data. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. https://doi.org/10.25921/saca-sp25).",

            "abstract": "These aerial survey data of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) off southern Australia were collected in August 2016. Such annual flights in winter/spring between Cape Leeuwin (Western Australia) and Ceduna (South Australia) have now been conducted over a 23-year period 1993-2016. These surveys have provided evidence of a population trend of around 6% per year, and a current (at 2014) population size of approximately 2300 of what has been regarded as the 'western' Australian right whale subpopulation. With estimated population size in the low thousands, it is presumed to be still well below carrying capacity. No trend information is available for the 'eastern' subpopulation of animals occurring around the remainder of the southern Australian Coast, to at least as far as Sydney, New South Wales and the populations size is relatively small, probably in the low hundreds. A lower than expected 'western' count in 2015 gives weak evidence that the growth rate may be starting to show signs of slowing, though an exponential increase remains the best description of the data. If the low 2015 count is anomalous, future counts may be expected to show an exponential increase, but if it is not, modelling growth as other than simple exponential may be useful to explore in future.",

Population surveys were conducted by CETAP to assess the distribution and abundance of whales, dolphins and sea turtles inhabiting the study area.\n\nPurpose:\nThis dataset is a subset of CETAP_AIR extracting animal sighting records with taxonomic information of species sighted added. The full dataset may be available upon request. Please contact the primary contact person for the proper use of the dataset.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nTurtles: Testudines (173749) =&gt; Testudines (948936)\n\nMetadata are currently being revised. Sighting points that were more than 2 km inland were eliminated. Those from 1 km to 2 km inland can be considered as on-water sightings. Those records have TRUE in the [Excluded] field to indicate that they seem to fall on land but may be correct sightings.",
